# DS 2023 Final Project – How Do NBA Stars Score?

This project analyzes 2024–25 NBA player stats to answer the question:

> **Among the NBA’s top scorers, is high scoring more closely tied to three-point volume or to free-throw volume?**

Using season totals and per-game stats, I compare three-point attempts (3PA) and free-throw attempts (FTA) against points to understand different scoring “profiles” among top players.
